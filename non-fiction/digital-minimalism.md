# Digital Minimalism
by: Cal Newport

## Preamable

Overall, I recommend this book to most people if they find themselves constantly anxious, distracted, unable to focus, and too-often flipping through their phone as a mindless reflex rather than with a specific goal in mind.

## Introduction

Modern digital life leads to exhaustion. Constant social media pings and refreshes fracture your life and attention into small shards, leaving you unable to live an intentional life.
- Attempts to use ad-hoc "hacks" or tricks to reduce digital distractions are not effective.
- On the other hand, neo-digital luddism is not the answer either.
- The solution is Digital Minimalism: effectively using technology to extract value while eliminating time wasting distractions.
- Spend less time with technology and more time doing high value things and maintaining high value relationships.

## Chapter 1 - A Lopsided Arms Race
- Early social media & mobile devices didn't set out with the goal of changing your life or demanding your attention.
- People join social media and use digital tools with good intentions, looking only at the value gained.
  - The tools quickly become addictive.
    - As it became obvious how much money there was to be made, they were intentionally engineering and designed to be addictive.
- The introduction of the Facebook 'Like' button in 2009 fundamentally changed the game.
  - Passive consumption --> interaction.
  - Posting things now felt like gambling, and likes/comments/instant feedback create a dopamine rush. Lack of likes causes sadness.
- In many cases, technologies are specifically designed to trigger addictive behavior.

## Chapter 2 - Digital Minimalism
- One-off, ad-hoc tips, tricks, and "life hacks" to kick digital addictions aren't affective long-term.
- New philosophy is needed: *digital minimalism*.
> Digital Minimalism: A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.
- Choose technology that supports your own deep values.
- Don't worry about missing the small things, worry about what might diminish the large things you already value.
- Maximizing convenience is less important than maximizing for value.
- Choosing to use something because it adds *some value* is not the right decision.
  - Instead, choose to use technologies because they are the *best way to support your already deeply held values*.

Three Principles:
1. Clutter is costly.
    - The minutes of our life are our most precious resource.
    - The cumulative clutter of many things can quickly outweight the value they provide.
2. Optimization is important.
    - Don't just pick things that add value, but optimize how you use them.
3. Intentionality is satisfying.
    - Be picky when picking technologies to use.
    - Do they allow you to live intentionally?
    
## Chapter 3 - The Digital Declutter

- Take a period of 30 days and stop using all "addictive" technologies and forms of social media.
  - Set rules to allow minimal usage as needed (for your job, for example), but in general you should cut everything out.
- This is not just a detox - you want to evaluate if these tools are actively adding value to your life.
- Fill your time with more positive activities instead.
- After the 30 day period, reintroduce technologies if they pass the strict questions:
  - Does this add value, and is it the best way to add that value?
- Use standard operating procedures to dictact how you interact with addictive technologies and social media.

## Chapter 4 - Spend Time Alone

Solitude is essential for the health of the human mind and body. Modern technology and smartphones make it all but impossible to spend time alone with your thoughts. People are at risk of being permanently unable to be alone.

Suggested practices:
- Leave your phone at home.
- Take long walks.
- Write letters to yourself.

## Chapter 5 - Don't Click "Like"

Online and offline interactions have a zero sum relationship. The more time you spend with one, the less time you have for the other. Because of this, spending more time on spcial media reduces more valuable offline interactions which leads to loneliness and depression.

- Social Media "engagements" are cheap and cannot reproduce the value of real world interactions that are bodies and minds evolved to expect and understand.
- Learn the difference between connections (cheap) and conversations (highly valuable).
  - Likes and comments on social media are just connections - not conversations.
  
Suggested practices:
- Don't like or comment on social media posts.
- Consolidate (batch) texting/messaging - don't be "always available". Use do-not-disturb mode on your phone.
- Hold conversation office hours.

## Chapter 6 - Reclaim Leisure

- Give preference to high quality leisure over low quality leisure.
  - Low quality: social media, web browsing, Movie/TV binge-watching.
- Pick up physical/analogue hobbies and leisure activities.
- Bennett principle: expending more energy into leisure can in turn energize you more.
- Prioritize creation and demanding activities over passive consumption.
  - Create things.
- Seek activities that require a real world social group.

Suggested practices:
1. Fix or build something weekly.
2. Schedule your low quality leisure time.
3. Join something (group/club).
4. Follow leisure plans.

## Chapter 7 - Join the Attention Resistance

Attention resistance movement: comhine high tech tools with disciplined operating procedures to extract value without getting sucked into the attention trap.

Suggested practices:
1. Delete social media from your phone. Restrict their usage to less convenient computers.
2. Turn your devices into "single purpose computers". Ironically, you can be more productive by disabling many functions of modern computers/smartphones.
3. Use social media like a professional.
4. Embrace slow media.
5. Dumb down your smartphone (consider using a non-smartphone).

## Conclusion

Digital minimalists see technology as a tool, a means to support things in their life that they already value. They do not value the technology itself. By doing this, you can effectively use technology to become a better human than before.
