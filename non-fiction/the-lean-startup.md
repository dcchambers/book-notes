# The Lean Startup
By: Eric Ries

## Preamble

These notes are a WIP.

## Introduction

## Chapter 1 - Start

Many startups fail because they treat their company like a rocket launch rather than driving a car.
With a rocket launch, you make complex plans early on and everything is set in stone before you launch. Tiny imperfections can throw you way off course with little ability to correct.
Instead you should treat your startup like driving a car. Make many small adjustments as you go and react to challenges in real-time. You have a steering wheel - use it.

The Lean Startup method borrows principles from Lean Manufacturing movement popularized by Toyota.

- Shrink batch sizes.
- Use just-in-time processes.
- Accelerate cycle time
- Get feedback faster.
- Draw on knowledge and creativity of individuals.

You should constantly be evaluating your work and progress.
Use the _Build-Measure-Learn_ feedback loop to decide whether you need to _pivot_ or _persevere_.
