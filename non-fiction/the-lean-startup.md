# The Lean Startup
By: Eric Ries

## Preamble

These notes are a WIP.

# Part 1 - Vision

## Chapter 1 - Start

Many startups fail because they treat their company like a rocket launch rather than driving a car.
With a rocket launch, you make complex plans early on and everything is set in stone before you launch. Tiny imperfections can throw you way off course with little ability to correct.
Instead you should treat your startup like driving a car. Make many small adjustments as you go and react to challenges in real-time. You have a steering wheel - use it.

The Lean Startup method borrows principles from Lean Manufacturing movement popularized by Toyota.

- Shrink batch sizes.
- Use just-in-time processes.
- Accelerate cycle time
- Get feedback faster.
- Draw on knowledge and creativity of individuals.

You should constantly be evaluating your work and progress.
Use the _Build-Measure-Learn_ feedback loop to decide whether you need to _pivot_ or _persevere_.

## Chapter 2 - Define

How is a startup different than a regular company?
- "A human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty."
- A startup can be of any size, in any sector, and in any location.
- It can be a small group in an already established company, a government entity, or a brand new VC-backed company.
- Main example/case study: Intuit + Snaptax

## Chapter 3 - Learn

- Be able to measure feedback quickly.
- It is understandable to not want to show your hand too soon, but waiting too long increases the risk of wasting time and money building a product that people don't want.
- Build a product people are asking for.
- Talk to customers.
- Main example/case study: IMVU

## Chapter 4 - Experiment

- Think big, start small.
- Try new things and don't be afriad to throw things away if they don't work.
- Always be experimenting
- Use the traditional scientific method.
  - Make a hypthesis and test those predictions.

# Part 2 - Steer

Remember the build-measure-learn feedback loop. Make the loop as fast as possible.

Planning happens in reverse order.
1. Figure out what you want to learn.
2. Figure out how to mearsure it.
3. Build the product to run the experiment.

## Chapter 5 - Leap

Be specific and clear with your thesis/prediction.

Leap of Faith
- Consider analogs and antilogs
- Be sure to fully understand the hypothesis

"Genchi Gembetsu" - "Go and see for yourself"
- From Toyota
- Do as much as possible to literally put yourself in the shoes of your customers.
