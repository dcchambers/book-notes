# The Lean Startup
By: Eric Ries

## Preamble

Some of the case studies in *The Lean Startup* feel a bit dated in 2022, but overall this book is still well worth reading for aspriring entrepeneurs and people that want to improve velocity/performance on their current teams.

# Part 1 - Vision

## Chapter 1 - Start

Many startups fail because they treat their company like a rocket launch rather than driving a car.
With a rocket launch, you make complex plans early on and everything is set in stone before you launch. Tiny imperfections can throw you way off course with little ability to correct.
Instead you should treat your startup like driving a car. Make many small adjustments as you go and react to challenges in real-time. You have a steering wheel - use it.

The Lean Startup method borrows principles from Lean Manufacturing movement popularized by Toyota.

- Shrink batch sizes.
- Use just-in-time processes.
- Accelerate cycle time
- Get feedback faster.
- Draw on knowledge and creativity of individuals.

You should constantly be evaluating your work and progress.
Use the _Build-Measure-Learn_ feedback loop to decide whether you need to _pivot_ or _persevere_.

## Chapter 2 - Define

How is a startup different than a regular company?
- "A human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty."
- A startup can be of any size, in any sector, and in any location.
- It can be a small group in an already established company, a government entity, or a brand new VC-backed company.
- Main example/case study: Intuit + Snaptax

## Chapter 3 - Learn

- Be able to measure feedback quickly.
- It is understandable to not want to show your hand too soon, but waiting too long increases the risk of wasting time and money building a product that people don't want.
- Build a product people are asking for.
- Talk to customers.
- Main example/case study: IMVU

## Chapter 4 - Experiment

- Think big, start small.
- Try new things and don't be afriad to throw things away if they don't work.
- Always be experimenting
- Use the traditional scientific method.
  - Make a hypthesis and test those predictions.

# Part 2 - Steer

Remember the build-measure-learn feedback loop. Make the loop as fast as possible.

Planning happens in reverse order.
1. Figure out what you want to learn.
2. Figure out how to mearsure it.
3. Build the product to run the experiment.

## Chapter 5 - Leap

Be specific and clear with your thesis/prediction.

Leap of Faith
- Consider analogs and antilogs
- Be sure to fully understand the hypothesis

"Genchi Gembetsu" - "Go and see for yourself"
- From Toyota
- Do as much as possible to literally put yourself in the shoes of your customers.

## Chapter 6 - Test

Build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) ASAP and start testing it with real customers/early adopters. Even if it's not scalable or really easy to use yet.
- An MVP allows you to *start* the learning process.
- An MVP is not automatically tiny or simple, but most people tend to overestimate what an MVP needs. When in doubt, err on the side of simple.
- MVPs attract early adopters.
- MVPs are used to validate a leap of faith assumption.
- MVPs can be something as simple as a video to dfrive beta signups (case study: Dropbox).

Wizard of Oz test: When the technology/product isn't ready yet but you need to start testing with users. The customer thinks they are interacting with the product, but it's actually a person controlling things behind the scenes. Not scalable, but it lets you get feedback immediately!

## Chapter 7 - Measure

Standard accounting is not useful to measuring entrepreneurs/startups. Too unpredictable for forecasts and milestones to be accurate.

Innovation Accounting
- First, use MVP to assess status of the company.
- Second, make small changes and optimizations to move your company closer to where you want it to be (from the baseline to the ideal situation).
- Third, decide whether you need to pivot or persevere.

Cohort Analysis
- Instead of grouping all users together when reviewing the company, group them into users who came to the product at the same time.
- Allows you to compare that cohort to other cohorts and see how yoru trends change over time.

Avoid vanity metrics (eg gross number of customers). Actionable metrics are far better.

Incorporate split testing experiments (A/B testing) into product development to gain actionable metrics.

Use kanban, but add a new column after "done" - the "validation" column.
- Validate all stories/projects and entsure they are tested with users.
- Confrim they are pushing the product in the right direction.
- Limit each column of kanban to a certain number of tickets (eg 3), requiring you to validate before you can continue more dev work.

All metrics should be:
- Actionable
- Accessible
- Auditable

## Chapter 8 - Pivot (or Persevere)

Don't let fear of backlash prevent you from demoing early/getting product into your users hands early. Gives you time to pivot often/early.

Don't view runway as months left before you're out of money, but as the number of pivots you can still make.

When to pivot: When you have decreasing effectiveness of product experimentation, and a feeling that product development should be more productive.

Have a pivot or persevere meeting every few weeks.

Types of pivots:
- zoom-in pivot: narrow your focus to a subset/single feature
- zoom-out pivot: single feature not enough to support product. Need more.
- customer-segment pivot
- customer-need pivot
- platform pivot (eg a single app to a platform)
- business architecture pivot (eg B2B <--> B2C, or low volume/high margin <--> high volume/low margin)
- value captvure pivot
- engine of growth pivot (ch 10 - viral, sticky, paid growth)
- channel pivot (sales channels)
- technology pivot

## Chapter 9 - Batch

Use small batch sizes. Single piece flow is preferred over mass manufacturing. For a tech startup, develop individual features and ship them out immediately to a set of users, with lots of automated testing to make sure your changes haven't broken anything.

Use continuous integration (testing) and continuous deployment/delivery.

Smaller batches all for faster build-measure-learn feedback cycles.

This is applicable outside of software as well.

## Chapter 10 - Grow

Four methods of sustainable growth:
- word-of-mouth
- side effect of product usage (eg a branded handbag)
- paid advertising
- subscriptions/repeat purchases

Three engines of growth:
- sticky - rely on locking in customers and making it hard or expensive for them to leave. Rate of customer acquistion has to exceed the churn rate.
- viral - depending on word-of-mouth sharing and growth as a natural part of using the product.
- paid - e.g. advertising. The value a customer brings (lifetime value - LTV) must exceed that of the cost to acquire that customer (COA)

Eventually all engines of growth will run out of gas - eg new customers. Need to always be looking for new methods of growth.
Some startups mistake product changes early on as reasons for growth, when it may be that they already have an effective engine of growth, which can lead to incorrect assumptions about product changes.

## Chapter 11 - Adapt

Going too fast can be harmful, use adaptive practices to slow down and fix mistakes before they become big problems.

Use the *five why's*. Ask "why" five times to uncover and trace root problems.

Promote a blameless culture. Requires buy-in from management to avoid becoming "the five blames." Be specific and start small. Don't bring old baggage.

## Chapter 12 - Innovate

Three things startups/startup teams need to foster innovation:
1. scarce but secure funding
2. complete autonomy
3. A personal stake in the outcome (financial or otherwise)

Fostering innovation:
- Don't keep the innovating teams hidden away in a black box.
- Create innovation sandboxes that enable your teams to run experiments. Follow all of the rules established so far (small batch sizes, use actionable metrics, have one team monitor the experiment from start to finish, etc)

Growing products from the innovation sandbox to success in the greater parent org can be quite challenging. Requires a strong leader - someone with the job title "entrepeneur" - who will see that experiment and product through from start to finish.

## Chapter 13 - Epilogue

Using a scientific, data-driven approach doesn't mean it has to be sterile, inhuman, or uncreative.
